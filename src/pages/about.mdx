import TimeSince from "@components/TimeSince.tsx";

<div style="display:none">
  {/* TODO: Dirty hack to get around the fact that the first instance of a loaded component has script and style tags that break <p> tag rendering. Need to figure out a fix for this. */}
  <TimeSince client:visible startDateTime="1988-09-30 07:50:00" />
</div>

I'm Daniel van der Merwe, and I'm precisely <TimeSince client:load startDateTime="1988-09-30 07:50:00" /> years old.
I live in a scenic little town on the West Coast of South Africa, surrounded by the sweet chaos of family life with my wife and two children.

I've accumulated <TimeSince client:load startDateTime="2008-01-01 08:00:00" decimalPlaces={2} updateInterval={100000} /> years of programming and business experience in a wide range of sectors like insurance, travel, media, you name it.
Currently, I'm the co-founder and Technical Director of a software development company called [Rokkit200](https://rokkit200.co).
The majority of my experience is on the Optimizely (formerly Episerver) suite of products with a strong focus on the .NET stack, although I'm not a stranger to front-end technologies.

Whenever I'm able to make some time I'm always tinkering on something related to quantified self, productivity, and tools for thought. You can find some of my [projects here](/projects).

I've toned down my social media usage a lot, but you can still catch me most reliably on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/vandermerwed).

## My Guiding Principles

My life and work are deeply influenced by the following set of core principles.

- **Add Value**: Be it a piece of code or a piece of advice, it has to enrich someone's life or process.
- **Honesty & Transparency**: I say it as it is. No sugar-coating or hiding behind jargons.
- **Growth & Improvement**: Stagnation is my nemesis. Iâ€™m always in pursuit of the better version of everything, including myself.
- **Accountability**: Mistakes are inevitable; owning them and correcting course is the key.
- **Cognitive Awareness**: I strive to recognize and understand [cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), both in myself and in the world around me.

## About This Website

This website is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, ideas, and projects. It's also a playground for me to experiment with new technologies and techniques.
I built it using [Astro](https://astro.build), a new static site builder that I'm very excited about.
It's a work in progress, so expect to see some changes from time to time. A full write-up on the tech stack and design decisions [can be found here](/projects/astro-elysium).
