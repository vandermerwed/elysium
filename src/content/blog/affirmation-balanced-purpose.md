> Today, I choose to honor both my commitments and my dreams. I'll give my best to my responsibilities but will not sacrifice my well-being. My time is mine to manage, my aspirations are mine to fulfill. I will not be solely defined by others' expectations. I can be effective without exhaustion, and my value is not determined by the number of hours I work, but by the quality and impact of my work.
