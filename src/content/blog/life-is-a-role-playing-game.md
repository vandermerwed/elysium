In the role-playing game (RPG) of life, you're the main character on a never-ending quest for growth, self-discovery, and personal victories. Just like in an RPG, you acquire new skills, unlock achievements, and sometimes have to face your own set of dragonsâ€”whether they're metaphorical or very, very real.

While there may not be an XP bar hovering above your head, every action you take and every decision you make is a chance to "level up." Your objectives might not be set by a quest giver, but by your own values and aspirations. There's no inventory screen, yet we manage a range of resources: time, energy, and emotional bandwidth.
