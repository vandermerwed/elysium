That’s 3 years and 10 months. Doing anything for that long deserves at least a celebratory post.

My medical aid provider, Discovery, has a program where I get rewarded if I meet certain fitness goals. One of the benefits is that they give you a free Apple Watch (or Oura Ring) and you pay penalty fees every week that you miss a fitness goal. So on 14 January 2022 I made a \[\[PACT\]\] to jog for 30min, three times per week to fund my Apple Watch.

What I’ve learned through this journey is that, come hell or high water, almost any habit can be kept up three times per week indefinitely as long as it is not too time consuming and you keep it simple. The way I kept this habit simple was by deciding that, no matter where I am in the world, three times a week I will put on my running shoes, pick a direction, jog for 15min, turn around and jog back the same way. No route planning. As long as I have a 45min window I can do a 30min jog, shower and be back to what I was doing before the jog.

Another lesson I’ve learned is that you can redefine zero. Let me explain, the best analogy I have for this are those digital kitchen scales. When you need to weigh something that needs to be in a bowl you can put the bowl on first and them make the scale ignore the weight of the bowl. So when you put in the ingredients in the bowl you’re weighing it without including the weight of the bowl. Congratulations, you’ve redefined zero. Now, you might be thinking where the hell are you going with this?

Ok so this is sort of how I see my jogging habit now. I don’t count three 30min runs as exercise anymore. It’s just maintenance, it is my non-exercise state. If I do an fourth jog or a longer jog I’ll count that as exercise. If I gym as well in the week, I’ll count that (for now). Eventually I’ll also zero out some sort of strength training ritual that will be my new baseline.

It reminds me of Arnold’s mantra about only counting reps when the burn starts.

He does not count the reps leading up to the burn. He only starts counting when it starts to burn. When the real work begins. Where the gains are.

I’ve written about \[\[streaks\]\] before and I’m not a fan. I’ll admit that this 200 week streak does cause me some anxiety and has caused some tension in my life where I’ve prioritized going for a jog over other commitments.

I don’t think I would be able to maintain another streak like this. If I do I for sure would not be able to manage a daily streak and I don't think I ever will. Unless of course it’s something like brushing teeth, that I can manage.

After 200 weeks I think I’m ready redefine another zero in my life. I don’t know if it will be weekly, monthly or annually but I’ll figure it out.
