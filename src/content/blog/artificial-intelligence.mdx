I have a page, a manifesto of sorts, on [AI](/ai) that explains ho AI is used on this website. It's a bit of a manifesto on the responsible use of AI in content creation and design. I've also included a disclaimer on the use of AI in the creation of this website's content.

I like using AI. But I think firstly using AI responsibly is most important and secondly using it effectively.

As a whole I think AI is potentially very bad for humanity but on an individual level it has the potential to speed up productivity immensely. 

AI is truly an unprecedented anomaly in our history that will fast track every single industry. Fast track is not the right phrase. Accelerate, rather. There as always been "unprecedented" hype cycles in the past, factories, crypto, insert example, etc. But this time it is just so damn accessible that it changes the game. It is also worming it's way into every single industry on the planet at an alarming rate. Way faster than any other technology that came before.

It is like a virus, spreading. Whether it turns out to be malicious we have yet to see.

To show how I use AI on this website I have created a component that is included on every page. It is a small snippet of text that explains how AI was used in the creation of the content on that page. It is a small step towards transparency in the use of AI in content creation.

Responsible AI Use tips:
- Always disclose when, and how AI is used in content creation.
- Use AI to assist in content creation, not to replace it.
- Try to refrain from AI when you don't know what the outcome is that you want, make sure you have a clear goal in mind.
- Always write the first draft yourself.
- Always edit the final draft yourself.
- AI is a tool, not a replacement for creativity.
- There is only one you, AI can mimic you but it can never be you.
- Remember that AI was trained on data, and that data is biased in many ways.
- We don't know what the long term effects of AI are, so use it sparingly.
- Understand it's limitations, it is not a magic wand.
- Confabulation (sometimes called Hallucination) is a real thing, don't let AI fill in the blanks for you.
