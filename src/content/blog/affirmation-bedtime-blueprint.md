Every night before going to bed, my kids recite the following affirmations:

- "Whatever your dreams are, work hard to make them real."
- “Be who you want to be.”
- “Never quit on a bad day.”
- “Always remember, mommy & daddy love you.”

I came across this idea from Robin Sharma's "The man who sold his Ferarri" years ago
