Digital gardens are a way of thinking about notes as living, growing ideas rather than finished articles. The metaphor shows up across the early web, personal wikis, and knowledge-management communities—places where writing is iterative, interconnected, and intentionally incomplete.

I use this section as a garden: quick seeds, experiments, and links that evolve over time. If you’re looking for polished writing, head to the Writing section. If you want to watch ideas grow, you’re in the right place.
