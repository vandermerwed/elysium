I don't like [[streaks]], they stress me out. Breaking one sends me into a downward spiral. Maintaining averages is a healthier alternative.

The idea is simple. If you miss a day, you do a few extra over the next couple of days to bring the average back up. If you know you won't be able to do the thing tomorrow, do extra today. You're managing a rolling total, not a binary pass/fail.

This doesn't work for every goal. It's excellent for goals with repetitions or numbers as targets. "Do 30 push-ups every day." "Write 500 words every day." "Read 20 pages every day." These can flex across a week without losing anything. "Meditate every morning" is harder to average out because the value is in the daily practice, not the total minutes.

## Why this works better than streaks for most things:

Streaks create all-or-nothing thinking. A 2020 study in CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems found that streak anxiety was the number one reason users abandoned habit apps.[^1] The moment the streak breaks, all previous progress feels erased. That's not a perception problem. That's a design problem.

[^1]: This maps directly to my experience. After breaking a 50-week jogging streak it took me almost three years to start again. The problem wasn't fitness. It was psychology. See [[streaks]] for more on this.

Research from University College London found that missing any single day of a habit has no measurable impact on long-term adherence.[^2] What matters is whether you come back. Maintaining averages builds that return into the system by default. There's no streak to break because there's no streak. Just a target average to stay near.

[^2]: Lally, P., et al. (2010). [How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674). European Journal of Social Psychology. The same study found habit formation takes anywhere from 18 to 254 days, averaging 66. Not the "21 days" myth.

Studies also show that 80% consistency produces nearly identical long-term results to 100% adherence, while being significantly more sustainable psychologically.[^3] This is the core argument for averages over streaks. You don't need perfection. You need a system that survives imperfection.

[^3]: This aligns with James Clear's "never miss twice" rule from [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. Maintaining averages is essentially "never miss twice" built into the structure rather than relying on willpower to recover.

## Where I use this:

Push-ups. I target a weekly total rather than a daily number. Some days I do 50, some days none. The average holds. Writing word counts work the same way. A 3,500 word weekly target is more forgiving than 500 words daily, even though the math is the same.

## Where I don't use this:

My jogging streak. That one runs on [[streaks]] logic, not averages, because the external incentive structure (see [[pact]]) is binary. I either hit 3x per week or I pay a penalty. There's no averaging out a missed week.

## The relationship between averages and streaks:

They're not opposites. They're different tools for different situations. Streaks work when the commitment is binary and the stakes are external. Averages work when the goal is cumulative and the stakes are internal. Knowing which to use where is the real skill.
