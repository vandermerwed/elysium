Almost any habit can be kept up three times per week indefinitely as long as it's not too time consuming and you keep it simple.

Simple means no decisions. I jog three times a week. No matter where I am in the world I put on my running shoes, pick a direction, jog for 15 minutes, turn around and jog back the same way. No route planning. As long as I have a 45 minute window I can do a 30 minute jog, shower and be back to what I was doing.

## What makes a habit survive:

- **Zero decisions:** Every decision is a chance to negotiate with yourself. "Which route?" becomes "maybe not today."
- **Location-independent:** If it only works at home it breaks the first time you travel.
- **Honest time commitment:** 30 minutes plus buffer, not "an hour if I really commit." The version that survives is the minimum viable version. Three times per week, not daily. Daily [[streaks]] collapse under their own weight for me. Three times gives slack for life to happen.

## The frameworks behind this:
James Clear's implementation intention formula is :[^1]
> I will `[habit]` at `[time/location]` so that I can become `[type of person I want to be]`.

His [Four Laws of Behavior Change](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary) map onto why my jogging setup works:
- **Make it obvious:** Running shoes by the door. Put on running clothes first thing in the morning. No planning required.
- **Make it attractive:** Discovery rewards me financially for doing it (see [[pact]]).
- **Make it easy:** Pick a direction, go 15 minutes, turn around, go back. That's it.
- **Make it satisfying:** The streak itself becomes the reward. Though this cuts both ways (see [[streaks]]).

BJ Fogg's [Tiny Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43261127-tiny-habits) recipe is similar but focuses on the trigger rather than identity:[^2]
> After I `[anchor moment]`, I will `[tiny behavior]`.

His core insight is that motivation is unreliable. Design the habit so it doesn't need motivation. His behaviour model, `B=MAP` (Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Prompt), explains why my setup works even on days I don't feel like running. The ability threshold is low enough that even minimal motivation gets me out the door.

Where Clear and Fogg diverge is interesting. Clear ties habits to [[identity]]. You're not just running, you're becoming a runner. Fogg is more mechanical. Anchor, behaviour, celebrate. Don't worry about who you're becoming, just make the behaviour automatic.[^3] My experience sits somewhere between the two. The identity piece matters (see [[progressive-taring]] for what happens when a habit becomes so automatic it disappears from your identity as "effort"), but the mechanical design is what got me through the first few months.

## When a habit becomes invisible:
At some point the activation energy required drops to near zero. You're not deciding to do it. You're just doing it. That's when it crosses into [[progressive-taring]] territory. The habit stops being effort and becomes baseline.

[[habit-stacking]] is a different mechanism. That's about piggybacking new habits onto existing ones. What I'm describing here is more about making a single habit so frictionless it becomes permanent.

## Open question:
Is three times per week a universal sweet spot or just my sweet spot? I haven't tested other frequencies with the same rigour.

[^1]: Clear, James. [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) (2018). His formula is a variation of what psychologists call "implementation intentions." The research suggests activities set for specific times and places are significantly more likely to be followed through.
[^2]: Fogg, BJ. [Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43261127-tiny-habits) (2019). Fogg argues that emotions create habits, not repetition. The first time a child gets ice cream they don't need to practice the habit to want more. This challenges the popular "21 days to form a habit" myth.
[^3]: This might explain why Clear's framework resonates more with people who want to change and Fogg's works better for people who want to add. "Become a runner" vs "do two push-ups when I make coffee." Different goals, different entry points.
