My personal retreat format is loosely based on the [Personal Retreat Handbook](https://faith-based-productivity.teachable.com/p/personal-retreat-handbook) by Mike Schmitz and also borrows elements from [Dr. Anthony Gustin's](https://dranthonygustin.com/) amazing [Annual Review Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2P_yL1Ah976P7MLicb55wgY2DY-39jP3Lvp810H6HQ/edit).
