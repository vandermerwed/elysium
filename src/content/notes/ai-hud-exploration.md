This is a fast exploration of what a HUD-style AI assistant might feel like in daily work: persistent, peripheral, and context-aware without becoming a full chat destination.

What I’m testing here:

- **Peripheral visibility:** The assistant stays present without hijacking attention.
- **Context hooks:** Lightweight prompts that reference the task at hand.
- **Low-friction actions:** Quick actions instead of long conversational threads.

If you want the thinking behind it, read Geoffrey Litt’s post above. It’s the spark for this sketch.
