I woke up just before midnight. Couldn't fall asleep again. I grabbed my notebook and started writing. I was getting close to [[../journal/200-weeks|200 weeks]] of jogging three times per week and I had this feeling that it had done something to my sense of effort. This sense that I changed what zero means. Redefined a baseline. The closest analogy I could reach for at the time was a kitchen scale.

Kitchen scales have a "Tare"[^1] button that allows you to remove the weight of a bowl from the measurement that comes after. When pressing tare you effectively make the bowl weightless, which allows you to then weigh only the ingredients.[^2] This is what I did with my jogging habit.

[^1]: Not to be confused with "Zero" which recalibrates the scale to zero when nothing is on it.
[^2]: Sometimes labeled as "T-Set" on some scales.

Jogging three times per week for 30min has become my "no exercise" state. It is my baseline. A habit becomes tareable[^3] when it becomes automatic. When no decision or motivation is needed to do it, it effectively disappears from your effort budget.

[^3]: Or is it tare-able? Sounds like tearable, which sort of works too. Or terrible, which in the case of my feelings towards jogging ironically also works.

> I don't count my sit-ups; I only start counting when it starts hurting because they're the only ones that count.
&mdash; Mohamad Ali

Ali instinctively did something similar with his sit-up routine. He tared out everything before the burn. I call this concept [[../notes/progressive-taring|progressive taring]]. Three 30min jogs a week don't count, it is maintenance. A fourth jog counts, 15min of a 45min jog counts, a strength training session counts.

(TK the progression/ratchet mechanism - needs rewriting)
The first time you start a new habit it takes a lot of motivation to do it and you feel good when you've completed it. The next time you do it it gets a little bit easier. What you're effectively doing is increasing your capacity. You're freeing up mental space and decision energy with every repetition of the habit. Until the habit becomes invisible.

This same principle can be applied to almost any habit. Let's take saving money for example. Decide on an amount you think you can save every month indefinitely. The first month it will be hard, the second will be easier. By month 12 it will feel normal. Then tare that amount.

There are limits. You can't infinitely stack containers on a scale without it toppling over or breaking the scale. You can't tare out all your exercise without injuring your mind or your body.

Fundamentally this approach is similar to moving the goal post in perception. In practice it has a very different effect on your psychology. When you keep moving the goal post further you need to keep trying to push yourself to reach it. When you redefine your baseline and see how far you can go after that you challenge yourself to bring your best. Push vs. pull. External vs internal.
