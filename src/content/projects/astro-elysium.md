I'll write a more about how to set Elysium up to work well with Obsidian in the future. In the meantime here is the repository: https://github.com/vandermerwed/elysium

It's based on the amazing AstroPaper theme: https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper

It adds support for:
- Obsidian style WikiLink syntax - [remark-wiki-link](https://github.com/datopian/portaljs/tree/main/packages/remark-wiki-link)
- Styling external links differently to internal links - [rehype-external-links](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-external-links)
- Incoming Links
- Outgoing Links *(Not fully implemented yet)*
