Relatively Productive was a short-run podcast where Jacob Pretorius and I explored pragmatic takes on productivity, systems, and the messy reality of doing meaningful work. It’s archived now, and the website episodes no longer play, but the show is still available on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1PLyALsrt2UbfSvyEccbcW
