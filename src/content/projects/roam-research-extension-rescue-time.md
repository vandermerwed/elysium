Features

- Focus Time Start Trigger
- Focus Time End Trigger
- Send to Highlights

Some sort of mechanism that asks after a focus session what you got done and what you still need to do etc. and rate the session. Then post this data to Roam (and RescueTime highlights?)

- Update current Toggl entry in Roam with information that was entered **if** toggl extension is installed and configured
