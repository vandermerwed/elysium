The extension adds two new commands to the command palette (`Ctrl + P` / `⌘ + P`):

1. **Toggl: Start Timer** - Starts a new timer in Toggl Track and writes the entry into Roam.
2. **Toggl: Get Current Running Timer** - Gets the current running timer from Toggl Track and writes the entry into Roam.

Planned commands:

1. Update Timer
